MyMoneyTrack is a lightweight, user-friendly budgeting application designed specifically for students and young adults aged 18–25. Unlike traditional finance tools, which often feel bloated or overwhelming, this app focuses on:

✅ Simplicity and visual clarity

✅ Manual control over all transactions

✅ Real-time insights with zero distractions

✅ Multi-currency support for international users

✅ Strong privacy — no automatic bank syncing or tracking

The app was built using a user-centred design process and refined through iterative feedback sessions and usability testing. It supports the creation, editing, and deletion of income and expenses, dynamic balance updates, and chart-based visualisation for better financial awareness.
Ideal for students who want clarity and control — without the noise.
